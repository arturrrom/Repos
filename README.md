## Work with Entity Framework
A basic Entity Framework Code-First console application that creates a basic Student database and adds one student.

## Technical skills gained
**1. Console Input/Output** The code utilizes Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine to interact with the user, prompting them for input and displaying output.
**2. Variables and Data Types** The code declares variables of integer type (int) to store package weight, width, height, and length. It also uses a variable of decimal type to store the shipping quote.
**3. Conditional Statements (if statements)** Conditional statements are used to check if the package weight exceeds a certain limit and if the sum of package dimensions exceeds a specified threshold.
**4. Arithmetic Operators** The code performs arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division to calculate the shipping quote based on package dimensions and weight.
**5. Control Flow** The program flow is controlled using return statements to exit the program prematurely in case of errors, such as when the package weight or dimensions exceed the allowed limits.
**6. String Formatting** String interpolation is used to format and display the calculated shipping quote in a human-readable format.
**7. Polymorphism** While the provided code doesn't explicitly demonstrate polymorphism, the concept could be applied when discussing more advanced scenarios, such as using interfaces or base classes to enable different implementations of methods or behaviors.
**8. Inheritance** Although the provided code doesn't directly showcase inheritance, it's a fundamental concept in C# where classes can inherit properties and behaviors from a base class. In a more complex application, inheritance could be used to model relationships between different types of packages or shipping services.
**9. Method Overloading** The code doesn't explicitly demonstrate method overloading, but it's a key feature in C# where multiple methods with the same name can exist in the same class, but with different parameter lists. This allows for flexibility in method invocation based on the provided arguments.
